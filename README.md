# BioAI-Nutrition

AI-driven wellness platform providing privacy-safe, personalized nutrition insights.  
Built with FastAPI, Next.js, and machine learning pipelines.

---

## Project Overview

**BioAI Nutrition** is a wellness assistant that analyzes lifestyle data such as meal patterns, activity, and sleep to generate personalized daily insights.  
It is **not a medical or diagnostic tool** — all recommendations are educational and intended to help users make sustainable, informed decisions.

**Core principles**
- Privacy-first data collection and storage  
- Transparent, rule-based explainable AI  
- Modular architecture for iterative development  
- Practical, user-centered recommendations

## Privacy & Ethics

- No health or diagnostic data is processed.  
- All insights are educational and non-clinical.  
- Personally identifiable information (PII) is minimized and pseudonymized.  
- Data deletion and retention policies are transparent and user-controlled.  
- The platform follows a **privacy-by-design** approach, reviewing data necessity for every new feature.

## Example Recommendation Rule

```yaml
id: fiber_boost_simple
when:
  daily_features.fiber_g < user_targets.fiber_g * 0.8
then:
  message: "Try increasing fiber intake by 6–8g/day: add an apple and a handful of almonds."
  rationale: "Your 7-day average fiber intake is below target."
  guardrails: ["vegan/food-allergy aware", "non-diagnostic"]
