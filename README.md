## Project Overview

**BioAI Nutrition** is a wellness assistant that analyzes lifestyle data such as meal patterns, activity, and sleep to generate personalized daily insights.  
It is **not a medical or diagnostic tool** — all recommendations are educational and intended to help users make sustainable, informed decisions.

**Core principles**
- Privacy-first data collection and storage
- Transparent, rule-based explainable AI
- Modular architecture for iterative development
- Practical, user-centered recommendations

## Architecture

```
User → Frontend (Next.js)
     → FastAPI backend → Data layer (PostgreSQL / Parquet)
     → Feature pipeline (Prefect)
     → Recommendation engine (Rules + ML)
     → Output (Personalized daily nudges)
```

---

## Privacy & Ethics

- No health or diagnostic data is processed.
- All insights are educational and non-clinical.
- Personally identifiable information (PII) is minimized and pseudonymized.
- Data deletion and retention policies are transparent and user-controlled.
- The platform follows a **privacy-by-design** approach, reviewing data necessity for every new feature.

## Example Recommendation Rule

```yaml
id: fiber_boost_simple
when:
  daily_features.fiber_g: "< user_targets.fiber_g * 0.8"
then:
  message: "Try increasing fiber intake by 6–8g/day: add an apple and a handful of almonds."
  rationale: "Your 7-day average fiber intake is below target."
  guardrails: ["vegan/food-allergy aware", "non-diagnostic"]
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL (optional, for full setup)

### Option 1 – GitHub Codespaces (recommended)
Open this repository in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to launch a preconfigured development environment.

### Option 2 – Local setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deokhwajeong/BioAI-Nutrition.git
   cd BioAI-Nutrition
   ```

2. **Backend (API) Setup**
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
   Access FastAPI docs at → [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

3. **Frontend (Web) Setup**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   npm install  # or pnpm install
   npm run dev  # or pnpm dev
   ```
   Access the web app at → [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

4. **Database Setup** (optional)
   - Install PostgreSQL
   - Run the schema: `psql -f data-contracts/schema.sql`

---

## Testing

Run tests for the API:
```bash
cd apps/api
pytest tests/
```

Run tests for the web app:
```bash
cd apps/web
npm test  # or pnpm test
```
